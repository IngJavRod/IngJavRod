### 👋 Hi! I'm a Mechatronics Engineer who loves solving problems with code, circuits and a bit of coffee.

I’m passionate about building things that actually *work* — from automated access systems and writing code to configuring networks and creating tools that make sense of data.

🔧 I enjoy working at the intersection of hardware + software, and I’m especially curious about:
- Smart automation
- Software development and programming
- Data analysis
- Network configuration & security
- Turning small ideas into working prototypes

🛠️ Tech I’ve been using lately:
Python · C++ · JavaScript · SQL · Excel · Tableau · Packet Tracer · Arduino (when I feel like tinkering)

🧩 I’ve taken online courses in Python, C, networking, and data analytics — I like keeping my mind sharp and my tools sharper.

🌱 Currently: learning, experimenting, and open to cool projects.
