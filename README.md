### 👋 Hi! I'm an Engineer who loves solving problems with code, circuits, and a bit of coffee.

I’m passionate about building things that actually work — from automated access systems and writing code to configuring networks and creating tools that make sense of data.

🔧 I enjoy working at the intersection of hardware + software — and now also full stack web development. I'm especially curious about:

- Smart automation  
- Software development and programming  
- Full Stack Web Development (frontend + backend)
- Data analysis and visualization  
- Network configuration & security  
- Turning small ideas into working prototypes  
- Extras I enjoy: Python · C++ · Arduino · Packet Tracer

🔌 I’ve always enjoyed the blend of code and electronics, but lately I’ve been focused on building complete web applications — from responsive UIs to secure APIs and data-powered backends.

🛠️ Tech I’ve been using lately:  
JavaScript · HTML · CSS · Python · Node.js · SQL · Excel · Tableau · Packet Tracer · Arduino

🧩 I’ve taken online courses in Python, C/C++, CSS, networking, and data analytics — I like keeping my mind sharp and my tools sharper.

🌱 Currently: building full stack projects, learning DevOps basics, and staying open to exciting collaborations or challenges.
